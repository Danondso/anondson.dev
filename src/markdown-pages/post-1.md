Angular front-end with a dark theme! Implemented implicit oauth flow using Okta as the identity provider. Users can login and perform CRUD operations on their tasks. Created claims for CRUD operations within okta and implemented logic to verify JWT token claims in the doer API, which wraps the mongo data store and provides endpoints to operate on tasks.
